                    <p>

                    <h3> Information from Third-Party Social Media Services</h3>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Due to the ability of users to store multiple access for the same third-party platforms we store
                        unique profile handles per platform to aid the user in identifying which account they are currently
                        using.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive
                        to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its
                        absolute security.

                        from our system immediately. We will revoke every and all access you granted to Us for the
                        usage of this product upon deletion. We can only delete personal data we have stored on our
                        database. Deletion of personnel from other third party databases even if linked from our service
                        will have to be requested directly from the third party. We provide information on how to perform
                        this for each third party service we provide.
